          Questions and answers
        
      
      
        
          Why use a VPN?
          VPN solves a number of problems: gaining access to blocked sites (social networks); anonymous access to web resources; access to geo-targeted media content (Hulu, Spotify, Rhapsody etc.); data protection when using Wi-Fi hotspots. In general, VPN is a very necessary thing, by the way, look at the video!
        
        
          Do you log my data?
          Security and anonymity of clients - the main priority of our company. Therefore, we do NOT keep any data that allow to identify users or track their activity on the Internet. For more details, view our Privacy Policy.
        
        
          What is Double VPN?
          Double VPN technology allows you to use two different servers for anonymous and secure access to the Internet. User is connected to the server in one country (for example, in USA), and goes online from a different server (for example, in Germany). The traffic between the servers is encrypted, and user’s IP address changes twice.
        
        
          Is it necessary to be a rocket scientist to setup VPN?
          You are not required to have special knowledge and skills to configure VPN - we have developed detailed manual that even a child can set up a VPN on your desktop, tablet or smartphone!
        
        
          What VPN protocols are supported?
          Any of our servers support VPN protocols - PPTP, L2TP/IPSec, OpenVPN. This allows you to configure the VPN-connection on any modern device and operating system.
        
        
          I have installed anti-virus/firewall. Will I be able to use VPN?
          Yes, of course. As a rule, there is no need to change any settings in the computer security software. But if anti-virus or firewall blocks the connection, please, contact our technical support team and you will be assisted in resolving the problem.
