  NordVPN has neatly emerged as a competitive offshore VPN company. It is tough contender in European market for VPNs though it can greatly expand its reach by adding servers and locations. Its remarkable innovations in the form of double anonymity and Tor over VPN make it stand out among the best players of the VPN industry.
	                
                    
                        
	                

	            
            
        

                

    




    
        What Does a VPN Do?
A VPN stands for Virtual Private Networks. VPN Services  serve the purpose of protecting your browsing information from hackers, ISPs  and espionage measures. It also hides or changes your location and IP address  depending on which VPN server you are connected to. They have many essential  uses such as security, privacy and protecting your personal data. 

  VPN services also come in handy when it comes to bypassing  geo restricted content such as a Youtube video that is not available in your  country. For example, if you want to watch a video that is only available in  the US, UK or China... Then you can connect to a VPN service that has servers  in those countries to access it without any restrictions. It is pretty simple...  Just follow our detailed guides: 

  Unblocking content and bypassing restrictions in US-only websites:
  VPN for US
     VPN for UK: Accessing region-locked content by using anonymous UK IP addresses    
    Bypass the Chinese Firewall and hide your online activity from monitoring using a VPN for China


When you subscribe to a VPN service, it usually comes  bundled with VPN software or apps that help you connect to their servers,  change your location and much more. For more information on how they work,  check out our VPN software reviews on VPN for iPad, Mac, Windows Desktops and  phones as well as game consoles such as Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4 and more…
