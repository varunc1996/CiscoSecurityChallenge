I used a threshold value of 0.95 when clustering and the results are in the uploaded clusterData.json. After looking at the results received, the given URLs are probably not the best use for the LSA algorithm. This is because many of the URLs had highly individualised noise (random words) that did not really contribute to the topic of the URL as a whole. This substantially effected the TF-IDF scores of the created matrices and definitely contributed to throwing off the accuracy of the results.

Latent Semantic Analysis typically requires dense text and some sort of relationship between the words used and the topics discussed in the text; which was not very present in the text of the URLs.
